Simple 2D plotter!

As part of a school project, we (Nick Herrmann an me) build a plotter to draw a tree. 
The gcode-files can be nicely visualized on this website: https://ncviewer.com.

Gcode is a format used to generate files that can be understood by CNC mills, 3d-printers and plotters. Here is a website that nicely explaines how gcode works and what the different commands mean: https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/g-code-explained-list-of-most-important-g-code-commands/.
